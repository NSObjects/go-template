# Repository Development Notes

This project scaffolds API layers (service, biz, data) from OpenAPI descriptions. When adding or modifying functionality under `internal/api`, keep the following in mind:

- **OpenAPI as the source of truth**: the base structs and interfaces for the service, biz, and data layers are generated automatically from the OpenAPI specification. Avoid making manual changes that would be overwritten by regeneration.
- **Extending generated layers**: place custom logic in separate files or clearly marked extension points so that automation can build atop the generated foundations without merge conflicts.
- **Consistent layer responsibilities**: ensure changes respect the layering contract documented in `README.md`â€”services expose transport logic, biz coordinates domain rules, and data talks to storage. This keeps the generated code predictable for downstream automation.

When updating templates or tooling that emits these layers, verify that regeneration from the OpenAPI definition still produces compilable artifacts before merging.
